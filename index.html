                            My name is Olga Serenchenko (soon to be Tanas...I still have to change my name to my husbands...oops). I was born in the
                            Caucasus Region in Russia. My family moved to the United States in 2001 and I've lived in Arvada,
                            Colorado most of my life. I received my BA in Geography-Environmental Sciences from the University
                            of Colorado Denver with a minor in Sustainability and a GIS Certificate. Currently I work for
                            The WhiteStar Corporation in Lakewood as a GIS Technician where I compile, edit, and provide
                            nationwide land data. I am an aspiring full stack web developer and am in a partime Coding Bootcamp
                            at the University of Denver.
                        </p>

                            When I'm not working or going to class, I enjoy spending time with my husband and new husky puppy. I love outdoor activities
                            like camping, hiking, and swimming. I enjoy cooking and searching for new, yummy recipes to try
                            out. I also like volunteering in community events and being an active member of my church. My
                            all time favorite activity, however, is travel. I've been lucky enough to visit Ukraine, Paris,
                            Vienna, Vietnam, Tokyo, and Bali but plan on seeing much more of the world.
